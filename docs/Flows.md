# Flows

A flow in Flowdock is a team workspace that contains a chat room and a shared inbox.

<div id="/list-flows"></div>
## List Flows
Lists the flows that the authenticated user is a member of.

By default, the list of flows only includes the flows that the user is a member of (i.e. the `joined` attribute is `true`). For flows with an `access_mode` of `organization`, the user must explicitly join the flow in order to be considered a member. For these flows, the `joined` attribute is initially `false`. A separate "all flows" resource exists in the API to list them.

```
GET /flows
```

### Parameters

| Name          | Description  |
| ------------- | ------------ |
| users | A boolean value (1/0) that controls whether a list of users should be included with each flow. |

| Name          | Description  |
| ------------- | ------------ |
| id | The flow's id. |
| url | The flow's resource URL. |
| web_url | The flow's web UI URL. |
| name | Human-readable name of the flow. |
| organization | [Organization](Organizations) information. |
| unread_mentions | Count of unread messages that mention the authenticated user. |
| open | Boolean value (true or false). Clients implementing tabs should display tabs for all the `open` flows, and list non-open flows elsewhere. |
| joined | Boolean value (true or false). If false, the user must explicitly join the flow to gain access to it. This can be done with a `PUT` request that sets the `open` attribute of the flow to `true`. |
| join_url | URL where new users can join the flow if `access_mode` is `organization` or `link`. Only present if `access_mode` is `organization` or `link`. |
| access_mode | How users see and access the flow. Possible values are `invitation` (the flow is invite-only â€“ new members have to be explicitly invited or added by existing members), `link` (anyone can join the flow by using the `join_url`) or `organization` (in addition to using the link, anyone in the organization can join the flow.) |


**Note**: Flow IDs have historically been in the form `organization:flow`, but new flows are created with random IDs.

## List all flows
Lists the flows that the authenticated user has access to or can join.

Includes all the flows from the "list flows" resource as well as the flows with an `access_mode` of `organization` that the user has not joined (`joined` is `false`).

```
GET /flows/all
```

### Parameters

| Name          | Description  |
| ------------- | ------------ |
| users | A boolean value (1/0) that controls whether a list of users should be included with each flow. |

## Get a flow
```
GET /flows/:organization/:flow
```
[URL breakdown](rest#/url-breakdown)

Get a single flow. Single flow information always includes the flow's user list. Otherwise, the data format is identical to what is returned with the list of flows. Timestamps are milliseconds since epoch.

Possible values are `invitation` (the flow is invite-only â€“ new members have to be explicitly invited or added by existing members), `link` (anyone can join the flow by using the `join_url`) or `organization` (in addition to using the link, anyone in the organization can join the flow.) |
