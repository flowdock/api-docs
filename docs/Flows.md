# Flows

A flow in Flowdock is like one single team workspace, which contains a chat room and a shared inbox.

In the REST API, Flow IDs are of the form `:organization/:flow`.

* `organization` is the parametric name of the client organization, as seen in the subdomain of the web URL of the flow.
* `flow` is the parametric name of the flow, as seen in the path of the web URL of the flow. Eg. `https://:organization.flowdock.com/flows/:flow`

## List Flows

```
GET /flows
```

### Parameters

* `users`: boolean value (1/0) controlling whether a list of users should be included in for each flow.

### Response
```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
Flowdock-User: 2
