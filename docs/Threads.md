# Threads

Threads represent entities in external services. They allow tracking events that happen in external services and collecting them into a single view of what has happened to the entity over time. Moreover, all the discussion related to the entity and its events is visible in the thread.

Common examples of thread entities are support tickets, issues in project management software and pull requests in version control software.

A thread in Flowdock API has the following format:

```
