# Messages

There are several different [Message Types](Message Types), you can upload files and set the user's status as well as send plain chat messages. Message is a sub-resource for Flow, so it should always be accessed in that context.

## Send a message
```
POST /flows/:organization/:flow/messages
```
Send a chat message, set the status, comment, upload a file...


### Input
* `event`
    One of the valid Flowdock message events. Determines the type of message being sent to Flowdock. See Message Types section below. Required.
* `content`
    The actual message. The format of content depends on the event. See Message Types section below. Required.
* `tags`
List of [tags](Tags) to be added to the message. Can be either an array (JSON only) or a string with tags delimited with commas. User tags should start with '@'. Hashtags can optionally be prefixed with "#". Tags are case insensitive. These are equivalent:
  * `["@Mike", "#cool", "awesome"]`
  * `"#awesome,cool,@mike"`
* `external_user_name`
  Name which appears as the message sender. This will change message to anonymous message, like it was sent from [Push API](Chat). _Optional_

```javascript
{
  "event": "message",
  "content": "Howdy-Doo @Jackie #awesome",
  "tags":  ["todo", "#feedback", "@all"]
}
```

### Response
```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
Flowdock-User: 2
```
```
{}
```

### Message Types
The event parameter in the message data defines the type of message. More at [Message Types](Message Types).

#### Normal Chat message
Event: `message`

For chat messages, `content` is simply a string which represents the chat message's content. Additionally, tags are parsed from the message content. _Maximum length of the content is 8096 characters._

#### Status Update
Event: `status`

`content` format is the same as with `message`. Sets the status of the user.

<div id="/send/files"></div>
#### File Upload
Event: `file`

The format of `content` is different depending on the `Content-Type` of the request. When using `application/json` the binary is sent within the JSON, Base64 encoded. Example:

```
{
  "data": "iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAAaCAYAAAC3g3x9AAAAGXRFWHRTb2Z0d2FyZQBBZG9iZSBJ\nbWFnZVJlYWR5ccllPAAAAElJREFUeNpiYECA/UD8n0y8nwENUGIYTkOpAhihplMNMFHbhVQ3kIVA\ncOAD/0k1kAFP+DIO3UgZTYej6XA0HY6mw9F0CAEAAQYAk/gtCSEUikYAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\n",
  "content_type": "image/png",
  "file_name": "cabinet_icon.png"
}
```

To send the file using form data, set Content-Type as `multipart/form-data` and set the value of content as the binary part. Here's a `curl` example:

```
curl -v -X POST -F "event=file" -F "content=@path/to/file.png" https://BASIC-AUTH@api.flowdock.com/flows/ORGANIZATION/FLOW/messages
```

<div id="/list"></div>
## List Messages
```
GET /flows/:organization/:flow/messages
```
Lists messages from a flow, filtered by parameters.

### Parameters

* `event` &ndash; Filter messages by event type. Leave blank to get all messages, which is also the default. Multiple event types can be specified by separating them with commas.

* `limit` &ndash; Maximum number of messages to return. Defaults to 30, accepted values range from 1 to 100.

* `sort` &ndash; Descending order is used by default in fetching messages. Use parameter value `asc` for ascending order. Note: the response JSON will always have the matching messages in ascending order by their id. The sort parameter is for toggling between fetching the latest or the oldest matching messages.

* `since_id` and `until_id` &ndash; Get messages starting from or leading to a message. The message specified with the parameter won't be included in the response.

* `tags` &ndash; Filter messages by tags. Multiple tags can be specified by separating them with commas, which results in an _AND search_ of those tags by default (see `tag_mode` parameter). When searching with user tags, you can use either the human-readable form, `@user`, or the internal form containing the user ID, `:user:12345`. See more at [Tags](Tags).

* `tag_mode` &ndash; Toggles tag filtering of messages, by default the value is `and`. Use value `or` to search for messages that contain any of the tags specified in `tags`.

* `search` &ndash; Full text search for message content. The search matches messages that contain all the specified keywords. Separate the keywords by spaces.
