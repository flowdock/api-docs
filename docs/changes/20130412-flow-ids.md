## Flow ID format
April 11, 2013

To enable more flexible changing of flow URLs and email addresses, flow IDs will be separated from these. This means that IDs can't be used to construct API endpoint URLs. Instead, `url` field should be used.

Starting from **May 15 2013**, the flow IDs will be UUIDs with no connection to URL format.

Currently messages use ID format separated by colons whereas in flow data, organization and flow name is separated by slash. After UUID format is deployed, we will also change flow IDs to use colons.
