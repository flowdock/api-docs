## Organization data format
October 4, 2013

In order to provide more information and a link to organization resource, the `organization` attribute of flow will change from the human readable name of organization (string) to organization information (object).

In addition, the attribute `id` of organization will now be a persistent numeric identifier, instead of the current subdomain that can be changed by the users. The flow and organization resource documentation has been updated accordingly.
