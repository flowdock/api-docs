## Comments api
October 24, 2013

Added support for posting comments using the [REST api](/api/rest) and [push api](/api/push). Comments can be posted using the REST api by posting to

```
/flows/:organization/:flow/messages/:message_id/comments
```

where `message_id` is the id of the message being commented. In push api it's also possible to specify the `message_id` to post a comment to a particular message. See further details from the respective documentation page.

Contrary to the comment messages received from the streaming api or REST message endpoints, the `content` is just a plain string and the event cannot be specified at this point to have a stable api for forwards compatibility.
