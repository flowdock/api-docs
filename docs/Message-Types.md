# Message types

> DISCLAIMER: We are currently working on renewing and expanding both the message types documentation and the format of some of the message types. Thus, they are subject to change.

This list explains the different types of messages you can expect when using the [Streaming API](streaming) or [Listing Messages](messages#/list). Bear in mind that undocumented internal message types exist and the duty is left to the client to discard them properly.
