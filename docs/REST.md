# REST API

Authenticate as a user. Get information about flows and post messages as a Flowdock user.

* [Authentication](Authentication)
* [Flow resource](Flows)
* [Message resource](Messages)

## Structure of an API request

### HTTP Method
We try to uphold the principles of REST in the API. Listing, showing and anything else non-state-altering is done with _GET_, creating with _POST_, deleting with _DELETE_.

_UPDATE_ is used for most update methods instead of _PUT_ because of its inefficiency and inconvenient requirements of idempotency.

### URL Breakdown
```
https://user:pass@api.flowdock.com/v1/flows/org/flow/messages/message_id
```

* `https` -- all the Flowdock APIs are served with secure HTTP *only*
* `user:pass` -- HTTP basic authentication credentials. You can use email/password or user specific tokens. See [Authentication](Authentication). **NOTE**: When using email/pass, remember to URI encode them. Characters outside the ASCII charset can exist in the e-mail address (the @ sign) and password.
* `api.flowdock.com` -- the API endpoint domain
* `v1` -- The version of the API. Optional. See [Versioning](Versioning).
* `flows` -- the resource which is being requested
* `org/flow` -- identifier of the resource. See [Flows](Flows).
* `messages` -- sub-resource, a resource which is accessed in the scope of the parent resource. Eg. all the comments of a Team Inbox item. In some cases there can be multiple sub-resources.
* `message_id` -- identifier of the sub-resource

### Body
Both JSON and HTTP POST data is accepted as request body formats. In the API documentation, JSON examples are used.

Example of posting a message:

```
POST /flows/organization/main/messages
```
```
{
  "event": "message",
  "content: "Hi all!"
}
```

Response:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
```
```
{}
```

### Headers

Content-Type must be defined with a header in requests that contain data.

```
Content-Type: application/json
```
or

```
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
```

Accept header should include `application/json` since that is the supported return format of the API

```
Accept: application/json
```

## Structure of an API response

### Response body
The API always returns JSON.

Example:

```
GET /flows/some_organization
```

Response:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
```
```

### Response headers

In addition to standard headers like `Content-Type`, the response headers also include the user id of the authenticated user in `Flowdock-User` header.
