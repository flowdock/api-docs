# Private conversations

A private conversation in Flowdock is like a chat room for two users. Note: the `open` attribute of a closed private conversation automatically changes back to `true` when new unread messages are added to the conversation.

In the REST API, Private conversations are referred with the recipient [User](Users) ID.

```
GET /private
```

* `id`: Private conversation ID, the same as the recipient user ID
* `url`: Private conversation resource URL
* `name`: Human-readable name of the conversation
* `open`: Boolean value (true or false). Automatically changes to `true` when new unread messages are posted into the conversation. Clients implementing tabs should display tabs for all the `open` private conversation, and list non-open private conversations elsewhere.
* `activity`: Activity information of the private conversation
* `users`: List of conversation participants

## Get a Private conversation
